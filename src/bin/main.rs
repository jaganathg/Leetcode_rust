fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
 
 /* 
 The  main.rs  file is the entry point of the program. It contains the  main  function, which is the first function that is executed when the program is run. 
 The  println!  macro is used to print the text "Hello, world!" to the console. 
 To run the program, use the following command: 
 cargo run
 
 This will compile and run the program, and you should see the output "Hello, world!" printed to the console. 
 Creating a Library 
 To create a library in Rust, you can use the  cargo new  command with the  --lib  flag. 
 cargo new mylib --lib
 
 This will create a new directory called  mylib  with the following structure: 
 mylib/
